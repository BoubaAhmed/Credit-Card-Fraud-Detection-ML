    # Project Overview
    st.header("üìå Project Overview")
    st.write("""
    This project focuses on **detecting fraudulent credit card transactions** using machine learning. 
    Fraud detection is a critical task in the financial industry, and this application aims to provide 
    a reliable and efficient solution to identify suspicious transactions in real-time.
    """)

    # Objectives
    st.header("üéØ Objectives")
    st.write("""
    The main objectives of this project are:
    - To build and evaluate machine learning models for fraud detection.
    - To preprocess and clean the dataset to ensure high-quality input for the models.
    - To deploy the best-performing model in an interactive web application for real-time predictions.
    - To provide users with insights into the data and model performance through visualizations.

    # Dataset
    st.header("üìä Dataset")
    st.write("""
    The dataset used in this project is the **Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset** from Kaggle. 
    It contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. 
    """)
    st.markdown("""
    **Key Features:**
    - **V1-V28**: Principal components obtained with PCA (anonymized features).
    - **Amount**: Transaction amount.
    - **Class**: Target variable (1 for fraud, 0 for non-fraud).

    # Methodology
    st.header("üîß Methodology")
    st.write("""
    The project follows a structured workflow:
    1. **Data Preprocessing:**
        - Handling missing values and duplicates.
        - Winsorization to treat outliers.
        - Standardization of numerical features.
    2. **Model Training:**
        - Three models were trained: **XGBoost**, **Random Forest**, and **LightGBM**.
        - Hyperparameters were tuned for optimal performance.
    3. **Model Evaluation:**
        - Metrics used: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC AUC.
        - Confusion matrices and learning curves were analyzed.
    4. **Deployment:**
        - The best-performing model was deployed using **Streamlit** for real-time predictions.
