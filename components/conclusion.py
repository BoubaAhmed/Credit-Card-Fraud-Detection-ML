    # Summary of the Project
    st.header("üìù Summary of the Project")
    st.write("""
    This project aimed to develop a robust machine learning system for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. 
    The workflow included:
    - **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, handling outliers, and normalizing the dataset.
    - **Model Training**: Training and evaluating three models (XGBoost, Random Forest, and LightGBM).
    - **Model Deployment**: Building an interactive Streamlit app for real-time predictions.
    """)

    # Key Findings
    st.header("üîë Key Findings")
    st.write("""
    - **High Model Performance**: All three models achieved exceptional performance, with accuracy and ROC AUC scores close to 1.0.
    - **Balanced Dataset**: The dataset was perfectly balanced, which contributed to the high performance of the models.
    - **Feature Importance**: The engineered features (V1-V28) played a significant role in detecting fraudulent transactions.
    - **Real-Time Predictions**: The Streamlit app allows users to make predictions on new data, both in batch and manually.

    # Future Improvements
    st.header("üöÄ Future Improvements")
    st.write("""
    While the project was successful, there are several areas for improvement:
    - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the hyperparameters of the models to further improve performance.
    - **Ensemble Methods**: Combine the predictions of multiple models (e.g., stacking or voting) to enhance robustness.
    - **Real-Time Deployment**: Integrate the model into a real-time transaction processing system.
    - **Additional Data Sources**: Incorporate more features, such as geolocation or transaction history, to improve accuracy.
    - **User Interface Enhancements**: Add more interactive visualizations and explanations to the Streamlit app.
